# Comics Display System - F5 Key Fix

This document explains how to fix the issue with the F5 key not triggering the comic sequence and how to use the added debugging tools.

## F5 Key Not Working - Common Causes & Fixes

1. **Missing ComicsDisplayController Instance**:
   - The main cause is that there's no active `ComicsDisplayController` instance in the scene when F5 is pressed
   - Solution: Add the `ComicsDisplayInitializer` script to a GameObject in your startup scene

2. **No Comic Panels Configured**:
   - The controller may exist but doesn't have any panels to display
   - Solution: Use the `ComicsF5KeyTester` to add test panels and debug the F5 key functionality

3. **Input Conflicts/Unity Input Settings**:
   - F5 may be mapped to other Unity functions or being intercepted
   - Solution: Try changing the trigger key in the ComicsDisplayController settings

4. **Time.timeScale Issues**:
   - If Time.timeScale is set to 0, the Update method might not be running correctly
   - Solution: The updated code now uses Time.unscaledDeltaTime for animations and timers

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Add ComicsDisplayInitializer to Your Scene
1. Create an empty GameObject named "ComicsInitializer" in your starting scene
2. Add the `ComicsDisplayInitializer` script to this GameObject
3. This will ensure a ComicsDisplayController exists when the game starts

### Option 2: Add ComicsF5KeyTester for Debugging
1. Create an empty GameObject named "ComicsDebugger"
2. Add the `ComicsF5KeyTester` script to this GameObject
3. Assign your comic panel Image components in the Inspector
4. Enable "Log All Key Presses" to monitor key detection issues
5. Run the game and check the console for detailed logs

### Option 3: Check Your Player Layer Settings
1. Select your ComicsTrigger objects in the scene
2. Ensure the "Player Layer" is set correctly to detect your player
3. Enable "Debug Mode" to see detailed trigger information

## Debugging Features Added

The following debug features have been added to help diagnose issues:

1. **Extensive Logging**:
   - All scripts now include detailed logging of key events
   - Enable/disable with the "Debug Mode" checkbox

2. **Key Press Monitoring**:
   - The F5KeyTester logs all key presses to help identify input issues
   - Periodic checks verify the Update method is running 

3. **TimeScale Safeguards**:
   - All animations now use unscaledDeltaTime to prevent freezing
   - Time.timeScale is properly reset when sequences end

4. **Layer Validation**:
   - ComicsTrigger now validates player layer settings
   - Logs which layers it's configured to detect

## Testing Your Fix

1. Add debug components to your scene
2. Run the game and check the console for logs
3. When you press F5, you should see "[F5Tester] F5 key press detected!"
4. If panels are configured correctly, the sequence should start

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check if the F5 key is being detected (look for key press logs)
2. Verify ComicsDisplayController instance exists (look for initialization logs)
3. Ensure panels are properly assigned to the test script
4. Look for any errors in the console about missing components

Remember to disable extensive debug logging in production builds to avoid performance issues.
